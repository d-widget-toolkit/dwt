DMD builds:
	Optimize generated code. For fastest executables, compile with the
	-release -O -inline -boundscheck=off

DUB builds:
	https://code.dlang.org/package-format?lang=json#build-options
	release-noboundscheck = ["releaseMode", "optimize", "inline", "noBoundsCheck"].
	(apparently a typo above: release-noboundscheck, should be release-nobounds)

	works for Eclipse DDT plugin:
	${DUB_TOOL_PATH} build -b=release-nobounds
