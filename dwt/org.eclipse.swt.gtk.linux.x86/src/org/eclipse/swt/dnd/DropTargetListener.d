/**
 * The <code>DropTargetListener</code> class provides event notification to the application
 * for DropTarget events.
 *
 * <p>As the user moves the cursor into, over and out of a Control that has been designated
 * as a DropTarget, events indicate what operation can be performed and what data can be
 * transferred if a drop where to occur at that point.
 * The application can respond to these events and change the type of data that will
 * be dropped by modifying event.currentDataType, or change the operation that will be performed
 * by modifying the event.detail field or stop any drop from happening on the current target
 * by setting the event.detail field to DND_DROP_NONE.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the user causes a drop to happen by releasing the mouse over a valid drop target,
 * the application has one last chance to change the data type of the drop through the
 * DropAccept event.  If the drop is still allowed, the DropAccept event is immediately
 * followed by the Drop event.  In the Drop event, the application can still change the
 * operation that is performed but the data type is fixed.</p>
