/**
 * Instances of this class are used to define the edges of a control
 * within a <code>FormLayout</code>.
 * <p>
 * <code>FormAttachments</code> are set into the top, bottom, left,
 * and right fields of the <code>FormData</code> for a control.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *      FormData data = new FormData();
 *      data.top = new FormAttachment(0,5);
 *      data.bottom = new FormAttachment(100,-5);
 *      data.left = new FormAttachment(0,5);
 *      data.right = new FormAttachment(100,-5);
 *      button.setLayoutData(data);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A <code>FormAttachment</code> defines where to attach the side of
 * a control by using the equation, y = ax + b. The "a" term represents
 * a fraction of the parent composite's width (from the left) or height
 * (from the top). It can be defined using a numerator and denominator,
 * or just a percentage value. If a percentage is used, the denominator
 * is set to 100. The "b" term in the equation represents an offset, in
 * pixels, from the attachment position. For example:
 * <pre>
 *      FormAttachment attach = new FormAttachment (20, -5);
 * </pre>
 * specifies that the side to which the <code>FormAttachment</code>
 * object belongs will lie at 20% of the parent composite, minus 5 pixels.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Control sides can also be attached to another control.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *      FormAttachment attach = new FormAttachment (button, 10);
 * </pre>
 * specifies that the side to which the <code>FormAttachment</code>
 * object belongs will lie in the same position as the adjacent side of
 * the <code>button</code> control, plus 10 pixels. The control side can
 * also be attached to the opposite side of the specified control.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *      FormData data = new FormData ();
 *      data.left = new FormAttachment (button, 0, SWT.LEFT);
 * </pre>
 * specifies that the left side of the control will lie in the same position
 * as the left side of the <code>button</code> control. The control can also
 * be attached in a position that will center the control on the specified
 * control. For example:
 * <pre>
 *      data.left = new FormAttachment (button, 0, SWT.CENTER);
 * </pre>
 * specifies that the left side of the control will be positioned so that it is
 * centered between the left and right sides of the <code>button</code> control.
 * If the alignment is not specified, the default is to attach to the adjacent side.
 * </p>
