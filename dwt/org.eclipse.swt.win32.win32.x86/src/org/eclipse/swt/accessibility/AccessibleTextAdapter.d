/**
 * This adapter class provides default implementations for the

 * Classes that wish to deal with <code>AccessibleTextEvent</code>s can

 * interested in.

 * Note: Accessibility clients use child identifiers to specify
 * whether they want information about a control or one of its children.
 * Child identifiers are increasing integers beginning with 0.
 * The identifier CHILDID_SELF represents the control itself.
 * When returning a child identifier to a client, you may use CHILDID_NONE
 * to indicate that no child or control has the required information.
 * </p><p>
 * Note: This adapter is typically used by implementors of
 * a custom control to provide very detailed information about
 * the control instance to accessibility clients.
