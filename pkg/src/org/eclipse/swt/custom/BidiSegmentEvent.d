/**
 * This event is sent to BidiSegmentListeners when a line is to
 * be measured or rendered in a bidi locale.  The segments field is
 * used to specify text ranges in the line that should be treated as
 * separate segments for bidi reordering.  Each segment will be reordered
 * and rendered separately.
 * <p>
 * The elements in the segments field specify the start offset of
 * a segment relative to the start of the line. They must follow
 * the following rules:
 * <ul>
 * <li>first element must be 0
 * <li>elements must be in ascending order and must not have duplicates
 * <li>elements must not exceed the line length
 * </ul>
 * In addition, the last element may be set to the end of the line
 * but this is not required.
 *
 * The segments field may be left null if the entire line should
 * be reordered as is.
 * </p>
 * A BidiSegmentListener may be used when adjacent segments of
 * right-to-left text should not be reordered relative to each other.
 * For example, within a Java editor, you may wish multiple
 * right-to-left string literals to be reordered differently than the
 * bidi algorithm specifies.
 *
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *  stored line = "R1R2R3" + "R4R5R6"
 *      R1 to R6 are right-to-left characters. The quotation marks
 *      are part of the line text. The line is 13 characters long.
 *
 *  segments = null:
 *      entire line will be reordered and thus the two R2L segments
 *      swapped (as per the bidi algorithm).
 *      visual line (rendered on screen) = "R6R5R4" + "R3R2R1"
 *
 *  segments = [0, 5, 8]
 *      "R1R2R3" will be reordered, followed by [blank]+[blank] and
 *      "R4R5R6".
 *      visual line = "R3R2R1" + "R6R5R4"
 * </pre>
